# [TIL] AI Insights: Professor Dae-Sik Kim & The Providence of Progress

## 1. The Strategic Vision of Prof. Dae-Sik Kim
Professor Dae-Sik Kim (KAIST) interprets AI not merely as a tool, but as a structural shift in the human experience. His insights can be distilled into three pillars:

* **From Answers to Questions:** In an era where LLMs provide instant answers, human value shifts to **"Critical Inquiry"** and the ability to define goals.
* **The 5-Year AGI Window:** AI's exponential growth and "Weight Matrix" knowledge transfer suggest human-level intelligence is imminent, requiring urgent preparation.
* **The "Roman Empire" Analogy:** As AI automates labor, humanity faces the risk of becoming "redundant," potentially pacified by digital "bread and circuses" (short-form content).

## 2. Personal Reflection: Stewardship and Providence

Professor Kim’s concerns are profoundly grounded in common sense. However, my perspective is as follows:

While a person may plan their course, they remain steadfast only when they align with the will of the One who guides their steps toward goodness. Throughout history, the Divine has seen fit to grant us individuals of **profound integrity and a "good conscience,"** and this remains true today.

There is a common thread that binds the architects of our modern world:
* **Guido van Rossum** (Python)
* **Linus Torvalds** (Git/Linux)
* **Demis Hassabis** (AlphaGo/DeepMind)
* **Sam Altman** (GPT/OpenAI)
* **Honglak Lee** (EXAONE/LG AI)

These leaders carry a sense of moral responsibility in their work. I find myself filled with gratitude for the providential will that allowed such visionary architects to shape our era with a spirit of goodwill.
